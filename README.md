# Nest+GraphQL+MongoDB School Project API

This is a GraphQL API, which developed by me in case of first part of School Schedule emulator.

Mainly, goal of this API - to serve a lists of lessons, students, providing other abilities such as creating new stundent or lecture, updating students list and assigning lessons to each other pupil in school schedule.

## Technologies I've used here

On my way to successfully develop this API, I've use the best Back-End JS tech-stack:

- **Nest.js**, very powerful, reliable and really flexible framework for Node.js;
- **MongoDB** as basic DataBase for storing all the data of my app;
- **GraphQL**, which also very flexible and also much more powerful rather than REST.

Generally, I've used JS during all development cycle. 

## How to Run the Application

0. **Downloading (cloning) source code**: Just clone this repo to your local machine.

1. **Installing Dependencies**: Open an NPM (Node Package Manager) terminal and run:

```npm install```

2. **Database Creation**: You really don't need to create a `School` DB, any collections or documents manually - this App will create all of them automatically.
